    HTTP method (GET/PUT/DELETE retry, POST does not), but *idempotent* overrides
    that: a ``POST`` that merely replays state (``/sync``, ``/unlock``) passes
    ``idempotent=True`` so a transient reset on startup is retried away rather
    than aborting the run before it begins.  A persistent failure is raised as a
    :class:`BitwardenClientError` so callers see a project error (and per-entry
    handlers can treat it as non-fatal) rather than a raw ``httpx`` traceback
    that aborts the whole migration.  *sleep* is injectable for tests.

        * **Personal vault** (both ``None``): all visible items.
